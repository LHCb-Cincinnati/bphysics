## MC simulation for the B+ four decay

The actuall ntuples location withing UC cluster are inside `sneezy` inside my directory 
```bash
/data/home/melashri/data/MC
```


**Key:**

* **MC16, MC17, MC18:** Simulation years (e.g., MC16 = 2016)
* **MD:** Magnet Down configuration
* **MU:** Magnet Up configuration
* **chic0, chic1, Jpsi** Intermediate resonant particles in the decay
* **Other Particles:** K, p, pi, Lambda0, etc.
